# Hi there 👋 I'm Y.K SUNNY

🇧🇩 From Bangladesh  
Learning coding & ICT all by myself since 2024  
Main teachers: YouTube + free online courses + random tutorials on tech forum + reddit. 
Tho Still a complete noob, but having fun building tiny things in my free time!

I love ai, tech, gadgets, mechanical stuff, and anything that looks cool 😄  
Here on GitHub I just dump my little hobby projects I make for fun. Nothing pro, just learning out loud.

If you see mistakes or something can be done better, please tell me! I really want to learn more.

Thanks for stopping by! 💙
